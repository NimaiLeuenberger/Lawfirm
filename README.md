# Lawfirm

This is a project from school that I extended at my one where I made a Website with Java Restful Webservices. 
A local glassfish is required to run the project locally in a virtual machine (that's how I made it). 

Description of the website:
The whole website has a system with cookies and different logins. 
I am going to describe the whole project with pictures.
Login:

It displays a list of lawyers but you can also click on a list of clients and legal cases.

You can log in and out with different users which can have the role "guest" where they can do nothing, the role "user" where they can look at the 3 different lists and spesific details:

and the role "admin" where they can do same as the role "user" and can edit, create or delete lawyers, clients or legal cases.

All the changes that are made on website will be saved in JSON files that are located on my local machine.

I've programmed this project on a VM with a glassfish server that was installed and configured by my school.
